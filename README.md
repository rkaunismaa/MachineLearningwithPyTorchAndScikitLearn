# MachineLearningwithPyTorchAndScikitLearn
This is my walk through of the book 'Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn' by Sebastian Raschka

Grabbed all the current code from https://github.com/rasbt/machine-learning-book 
and then replicated the first 11 chapters code and figures into this repo.

Then ran them through the local docker environment pt1121:20230205 ... They all run fine and do not use the GPU.
